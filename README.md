# `libdji` a library to manage DJI Osmo via BLE for Qt

This is actually just a blind port of [github.com/xaionaro-go/djictl (pkg/djictl)](https://github.com/xaionaro-go/djictl/tree/main/pkg/djictl) to Qt.
The last commit reached parity with is: [645a14056614d68613ca47264e3bd26d9ef16c25](https://github.com/xaionaro-go/djictl/commit/645a14056614d68613ca47264e3bd26d9ef16c25).

The inital purpose of this library is to use it in the Qt app I'm developing here:
https://github.com/wing-out/ui

## Quick demo

A CLI demo is available that drives a real BLE device through pairing, WiFi connection, and streaming start (similar to `cmd/djictl/main.go`).

### Build

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build
```

### Run

```bash
./build/tests/dji_demo \
  --wifi-ssid "your-ssid" \
  --wifi-psk "your-psk" \
  --rtmp-url "rtmp://host/app"
```

Optional flags:

* `--filter-device-addr` (default empty): substring match against the BLE device address
* `--timeout` (seconds, default `60`): overall timeout for the flow

## Usage

### Dependencies

libdji requires Qt6 with Core and Bluetooth modules. Ensure you have Qt6 installed on your system.

### Building the Library

To build libdji as a static library:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
```

This will create `libdji.a` (or equivalent) in the build directory.

### Integrating into Your Qt Project

1. Add libdji to your CMake project:

```cmake
find_package(Qt6 REQUIRED COMPONENTS Core Bluetooth)

# Assuming libdji is built in a subdirectory or external path
add_subdirectory(path/to/libdji)

target_link_libraries(your_target
    dji
    Qt6::Core
    Qt6::Bluetooth
)
```

2. Include the headers in your code:

```cpp
#include <dji/device_manager.h>
#include <dji/device.h>
// Include other headers as needed
```

### Basic Usage Example

Here's a basic example of how to use libdji to connect to a DJI device and start streaming:

```cpp
#include <QCoreApplication>
#include <dji/device_manager.h>

class MyController : public QObject {
    Q_OBJECT
public:
    MyController(QObject *parent = nullptr) : QObject(parent) {
        m_manager = new dji::DeviceManager(nullptr, this);

        // Connect signals
        connect(m_manager, &dji::DeviceManager::deviceChanged, this, &MyController::onDeviceChanged);
        connect(m_manager, &dji::DeviceManager::finished, this, &MyController::onFinished);
        connect(m_manager, &dji::DeviceManager::error, this, &MyController::onError);
        connect(m_manager, &dji::DeviceManager::log, this, &MyController::onLog);
    }

    void start() {
        dji::StreamingOptions opts;
        opts.ssid = "your-wifi-ssid";
        opts.psk = "your-wifi-password";
        opts.rtmpUrl = "rtmp://your-stream-server/live";
        // Optional: set resolution, bitrate, fps, filters

        m_manager->startDiscovery(opts);
    }

private slots:
    void onDeviceChanged() {
        if (auto device = m_manager->device()) {
            // Device discovered, start connection and streaming
            dji::StreamingOptions opts;
            opts.ssid = "your-wifi-ssid";
            opts.psk = "your-wifi-password";
            opts.rtmpUrl = "rtmp://your-stream-server/live";
            m_manager->connectToWiFiAndStartStreaming(device, opts);
        }
    }

    void onFinished(dji::Device *device, bool success) {
        if (success) {
            qInfo() << "Successfully connected and started streaming";
        } else {
            qWarning() << "Failed to complete the flow";
        }
    }

    void onError(const QString &message) {
        qCritical() << "Error:" << message;
    }

    void onLog(const QString &message) {
        qInfo() << message;
    }

private:
    dji::DeviceManager *m_manager;
};
```

### API Overview

#### DeviceManager

The main class for managing DJI devices and connection flows.

**Key Methods:**
- `startDiscovery(const DiscoveryOptions &options)`: Start BLE device discovery
- `connectToWiFiAndStartStreaming(Device *dev, const StreamingOptions &options)`: Connect to WiFi and start RTMP streaming
- `device()`: Get the currently managed device
- `devices()`: Get list of discovered devices

**Signals:**
- `deviceChanged()`: Emitted when a device is discovered or changed
- `finished(Device *device, bool success)`: Emitted when the connection/streaming flow completes
- `error(const QString &message)`: Emitted on errors
- `log(const QString &message)`: Emitted for log messages

#### Device

Represents a DJI device with BLE communication capabilities.

**Key Methods:**
- `connectToDevice()`: Connect to the BLE device
- `disconnectFromDevice()`: Disconnect from the BLE device
- `sendMessage(const Message &msg)`: Send a message to the device
- `isConnected()`: Check if BLE connected
- `isInitialized()`: Check if device is initialized

**Subsystems:**
- `pairer()`: Access pairing subsystem
- `streamer()`: Access streaming subsystem
- `configurer()`: Access configuration subsystem

#### DiscoveryOptions

Struct containing discovery filters:

- `deviceAddrFilter`: Filter devices by BLE address substring
- `deviceNameFilter`: Filter devices by name substring

#### StreamingOptions

Struct containing connection parameters:

- `ssid`: WiFi network name
- `psk`: WiFi password
- `rtmpUrl`: RTMP streaming URL
- `resolution`: Video resolution (default: 1080p)
- `bitrateKbps`: Bitrate in kbps (default: 4000)
- `fps`: Frames per second (default: 25)

### Advanced Usage

For more advanced use cases, you can implement custom device flows using the `DeviceFlow` class and subsystems like `SubsystemPairer`, `SubsystemStreamer`, and `SubsystemConfigurer`.

Refer to the test files and source code for detailed examples of subsystem usage.
